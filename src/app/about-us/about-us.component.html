        This is a country full of hustle. People work multiple jobs and put in
        long hours. There is a lot happening here and everyone is doing whatever
        they can to have a better future for both themselves and their families
        – that’s a lot of change and potential.

        It’s not uncommon for groups of tourists to get invited into homes or
        businesses to join a meal. When it’s time to celebrate, people go all
        out in Vietnam, with enormous – and equally delicious – meals, along
        with parties that can go well into the night. Even in day-to-day life,
        you’ll encounter many selfless acts. People often go out of their way to
        give foreigners a good impression of Vietnam.

        In terms of export tonnage, Vietnam is the second-largest producer of
        coffee in the world. For such a tiny country, geographically, that’s
        quite a feat. The mountainous rainforests of central Vietnam are perfect
        for growing the robusta strain of coffee beans – and anyone who has had
        Vietnamese coffee can attest to its potency.

        It’s no secret that Vietnamese food is great, and one of the real
        pleasures of travelling or living in Vietnam is trying dishes you’ve
        never had before. There’s actually an impressive variety to Vietnamese
        food, and chefs are creating new variations on the classics all the
        time. Just about every meal in Vietnam is another reason to love them.
