        <p>This is a country full of hustle. People work multiple jobs and put in long hours. There is a lot happening here and everyone is doing whatever they can to have a better future for both themselves and their families – that’s a lot of change and potential.</p>
        <p>It’s not uncommon for groups of tourists to get invited into homes or businesses to join a meal. When it’s time to celebrate, people go all out in Vietnam, with enormous – and equally delicious – meals, along with parties that can go well into the night. Even in day-to-day life, you’ll encounter many selfless acts. People often go out of their way to give foreigners a good impression of Vietnam.</p>

        <h4>They are great cooks</h4>
        <h6>With Passion For Real, Good Food</h6>
        <p>In terms of export tonnage, Vietnam is the second-largest producer of coffee in the world. For such a tiny country, geographically, that’s quite a feat. The mountainous rainforests of central Vietnam are perfect for growing the robusta strain of coffee beans – and anyone who has had Vietnamese coffee can attest to its potency.</p>
        <p>It’s no secret that Vietnamese food is great, and one of the real pleasures of travelling or living in Vietnam is trying dishes you’ve never had before. There’s actually an impressive variety to Vietnamese food, and chefs are creating new variations on the classics all the time. Just about every meal in Vietnam is another reason to love them</p>
